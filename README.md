## $tock Market Wonderland

 The Stock Market Wonderland is a desktop and mobile application that provides a helpful way to search for, invest in and keep track of the user’s favorite national and global stocks.
     
 The app features a dashboard that displays a clear visual of the user’s Investment Portfolio. From the navigation bar located at the bottom of the screen, the user can easily move from one page to another to view the stocks they currently hold in Stocks and their Watchlist, Crypto Currency, Currency Exchange, the latest Stock Market News, as well as transfer funds for trading and change their account information under the Profile link. Users can also search for stocks using the company name or ticker.
     
 To bring our app to life, our group will implement a number of APIs such as a stock, crypto, and mutual funds APIs, as well a currency exchange rate and news APIs. For the user to log in we will create and set up a database through Firebase with user authentication feature.
